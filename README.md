Parky connects drivers looking for parking to homeowners with empty driveways.
This app is a prototype built for the Boston area. As of 2014, Parky is not being actively maintained. For demonstration purposes only.

A [live demo is built here](http://parky.sqsinger.com/)

You may set up your own instance of Parky using the files included here.
	1. Import the database: create a DB named "parkies" and run the included parkies.sql file.
	2. Edit database credentials as needed in app/Config/database.php
	3. Access the app in your local environment, and enjoy!

You may log in as a test user, with both username and password as "test".

Parky is built using a LAMP stack, Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, and other technologies including the framework CakePHP. More information on CakePHP below.

CakePHP

[![CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/img/cake-logo.png)](http://www.cakephp.org)

CakePHP is a rapid development framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Active Record, Association Data Mapping, Front Controller and MVC.
Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.
